					Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
					object known to harbour and support life. 29.2% of Earth's surface is
					land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is
					covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other
					salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other freshwater,
					which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar
					regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into
					several rigid tectonic plates[list] that migrate across the surface
					over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a
					solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's
					magnetic field, and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                    <br>
					Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
					System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times
					that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but
					slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the
					third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon
					and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named
					after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its
					observed size.

                    <br>
					Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
					in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars
					carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
					the "Red Planet".[18][19] The latter refers to the effect of the iron
					oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
					(as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible
					to the naked eye.[20] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin
					atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of
					the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                    <br>
					Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to
					the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest
					of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
					(Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator
					between gods and mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes
					(Ἑρμῆς). Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
					inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from
					Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet
					can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern
					horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight.

					<button class="modal-button" id="close5" href="#">X</button>
					Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In
					the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the
					third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
					times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
					Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because
					its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
					atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an
					average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is
					named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol
					♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

					<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn -->
                    <br>
					Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the
					Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius
					of about nine and a half times that of Earth.[22][23] It only has
					one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
					volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.[24][25][26] Saturn is
					named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical
					symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where
					it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an
					abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet.[27]
					It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross
					added at the top in the 16th century.

				<p class="uranus-info modal hidden">
					<button class="modal-button" id="close7" href="#">X</button>
					<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus -->
                    <br>
					Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to
					the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology,
					was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus
					(Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-largest
					planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar
					System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have
					bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
					giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
					Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other
					giant planets. 
				<p class="venus-info modal hidden">

					<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus-->
                    <br>
					Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman
					goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's
					night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to
					the naked eye in broad daylight.[18][19] Venus lies within Earth's
					orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either
					setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little
					while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It
					has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation
					period of 243 Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate
					about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so
					in the opposite direction to all but Uranus.
